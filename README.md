Building scalable data systems, production-ready ML pipelines, and executive-level analytics that turn raw data into strategic decisions.

👨🏾‍💻 About Me

I am a data professional with a background in analytical chemistry and advanced training in business analytics (AI concentration). My work sits at the intersection of:

Data Engineering

Predictive Modeling

Analytics Engineering

Executive Data Storytelling

Business Strategy through Data

I design systems that don’t just analyze data — they structure it, operationalize it, and translate it into action.

🧠 Core Technical Expertise
🔹 Data Engineering

JSON normalization & schema reconciliation

ETL / ELT pipeline development

Composite key engineering

Identity resolution

Data cleaning & transformation

CSV production exports for system ingestion

Data validation & quality checks

Tools: Python (pandas, NumPy), SQL, Salesforce Data Structures, Workday Worker JSON

🔹 Analytics Engineering

Feature engineering frameworks

Metric definition & business alignment

ColumnTransformer pipelines

Data modeling for analytics layers

Threshold optimization

Reproducible ML workflows

Tools: scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, matplotlib

🔹 Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost

ROC-AUC optimization

Threshold sweep evaluation

Business cost-sensitive decision modeling

🔹 Data Science & Business Intelligence

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Executive dashboards

Data storytelling (Monroe’s Motivated Sequence)

Strategic recommendations

Enrollment trend forecasting

📂 Selected Projects
🔹 Workday → Salesforce Data Integration Pipeline

Type: Data Engineering System

Designed and implemented a structured pipeline to:

Parse nested Workday Worker JSON

Normalize schema

Engineer composite account-contact relationships (ACR)

Align supervisory organizations

Validate email mapping across systems

Generate production-ready CREATE/UPDATE CSV exports

Correct 8,000+ primary account mapping inconsistencies

Impact: Production-ready transformation logic for enterprise system integration.

🔹 Customer Churn Early Warning System (TruSource)

Built a full predictive ML pipeline:

Feature engineering (tenure bins, bundle count, bill shock indicators)

Model comparison across 4 algorithms

ROC-AUC evaluation and interpretation

Threshold sweep optimization

Business-aligned retention strategy recommendations

Final Model Selected Based On:

ROC-AUC performance

Stability across folds

Business threshold sensitivity

This project demonstrates both technical rigor and executive translation.

🔹 Customer Retention Feature Engineering Framework

Engineered predictive features including:

Bundle usage aggregation

Behavioral binary encoding

Structured preprocessing pipelines

Model-ready dataset transformation

Focus: Turning messy raw inputs into ML-ready structured data.

🔹 Enrollment Momentum & Strategic Trend Analysis

Cleaned and transformed FTE enrollment data

Designed executive-level visual narratives

Removed cognitive overload in visualization

Connected analytics to leadership strategy

Theme: “Momentum Doesn’t Sustain Itself.”

🔹 Opioid & Auto Sales Data Storytelling Projects

Structured large datasets

Designed pivot-based aggregations

Delivered persuasive executive-ready insights

Applied structured storytelling frameworks

🏗 My Engineering Philosophy

I believe strong data work must:

Be structurally sound

Be reproducible

Be interpretable

Align with business objectives

Scale beyond notebooks

Data is not valuable because it exists.
It is valuable because it is engineered into decisions.
